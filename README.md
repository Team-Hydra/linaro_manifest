Linaro Manifest
===========

Getting Started
---------------

To get started with a Linaro build, you'll need to get familiar with Git and Repo.

To initialize your local repository using the Linaro trees, use a command like this:

    repo init -u git://github.com/Team-Hydra/linaro_manifest.git -b linaro_android_4.4

Then to sync up:

    repo sync
